### Summary
This PR introduces a new Weather widget to CasaOS-UI. The widget displays current temperature, weather description, wind, humidity, and a mini temperature chart. Users can select their city from a dropdown.

### Features
- Displays current temperature and “feels like” temperature
- Shows weather description (e.g., cloudy, sunny)
- Displays humidity and wind stats
- 3-hourly forecast chart for the next 8 entries
- City selection dropdown with localStorage persistence

### Notes
- Fully compatible with Vue 2
- Uses OpenWeatherMap API (API key included for demo purposes)
- Styling follows the current CasaOS-UI theme
- Uses static emoji for weather icons (to be updated later)
